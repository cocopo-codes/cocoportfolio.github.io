> Hi there, and nice to meet you!
>
> I've been writing, drawing, and creating things my whole life. I have been lucky enough to write professionally for some of that time. I have two big dogs, a loud laugh, and I love to roller skate. I hope that something I made brings you joy or touches your heart in some way.
