# Coco Poley
## _Creative Content Marketer & Writer | Blending Tech Expertise with Engaging Storytelling | Driving Audience Growth Across Industries_

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1815504471402680320/nH_j_kTR_400x400.jpg" width="25%" align="left" alt="Coco Poley, writer, illustrator, and programmer">

Hi, I’m Coco—a storyteller at heart, blending technical precision with a love for making complex ideas accessible and relatable. With roots in data engineering and software QA, I craft content that bridges the gap between developers, businesses, and everyday readers. Whether I’m demystifying APIs or analyzing the cultural ripple effects of a sci-fi masterpiece, I aim to inspire curiosity and connection through my writing.

My work spans tech, pop culture, and entertainment, with bylines in outlets like The Mary Sue and Stack Overflow. I love exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, often weaving the technical with the human to tell stories that resonate.

When I’m not deep-diving into a narrative or a piece of code, I’m working on my newsletter or scheming ways to create a new story.

Thanks for visiting—welcome to my little corner of the web!
