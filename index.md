# Coco Poley
## _Creative Content Marketer & Writer | Blending Tech Expertise with Engaging Storytelling | Driving Audience Growth Across Industries_

Hi, I’m Coco—a technical content marketer with a knack for breaking down complex ideas into approachable, engaging narratives. My work spans tech, pop culture, and entertainment, with bylines in outlets like The Mary Sue and Stack Overflow. Thanks to my roots in data engineering and software QA, I create content that speaks to developers, businesses, and everyday readers alike.

From APIs to pop culture analysis, my storytelling approach prioritizes connection. I aim to inspire trust and curiosity, whether I’m demystifying technical processes or unpacking the cultural significance of a sci-fi masterpiece.

When I’m not writing, you’ll find me working on my newsletter, Coco’s Catchall, or brainstorming ways to merge technology and creativity into something extraordinary.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio.
